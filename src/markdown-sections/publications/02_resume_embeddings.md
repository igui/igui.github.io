In this paper, we explore how users' clicks and interactions with search results can teach us about the hidden connections between different search results. By analyzing these interactions, we can build a model that identifies which search results are similar in a way that isn't obvious at first. We use advanced techniques like contrastive learning with BERT models to train this similarity model, which helps us make better recommendations based on what users are actually interested in. This work was based on research made while I was working at [Hired](https://hired.com).
