In this paper, we introduce a new method to help designers achieve their lighting goals more efficiently. By combining photon tracing with an optimization technique, our approach handles various lighting needs without requiring lots of computing power, and it works well even when the space's shape is part of the design. This paper was based on my Computer Engineering thesis at [UdelaR](https://www.fing.edu.uy/).
