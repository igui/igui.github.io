#### Full Stack Sofrware Engineer

##### 2018 - 2020

As a full-stack software engineer on the Candidate team, I focused on enhancing our platform's efficiency and user engagement. I decreased onboarding flow attrition by 10% by migrating part of the flow from HAML to React and Redux, significantly streamlining the user experience. Additionally, I improved our CI/CD build performance by 100%, optimizing our deployment processes.

I was also involved in integrating an external assessments system, which significantly increased candidate engagement on our platform. This new feature was used by 25% of the candidates, demonstrating its effectiveness and relevance. I worked with technologies including React, Redux, Ruby on Rails, PostgreSQL, Apache Kafka, AWS, and Heroku throughout these projects.
