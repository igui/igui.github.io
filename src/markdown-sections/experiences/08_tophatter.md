#### Full Stack

##### 2020 - 2021

As a Software Engineer at Tophatter, I led several key projects to enhance the platform's functionality and user experience. I utilized technologies such as React, TypeScript, Ruby on Rails, and AWS. My leadership helped streamline operations and improve the user interface.

Transitioning to a role as a Machine Learning Engineer, I developed a recommender system to increase user engagement by suggesting relevant items, becoming the primary navigation method on the platform. I employed a shallow Neural Network, which outperformed the older rule-based system, particularly in attracting and retaining new users. For this, I used technologies like Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, and XGBoost. This initiative, driven by the CEO, was successfully integrated into the website through A/B testing, enhancing user interaction and boosting engagement.
