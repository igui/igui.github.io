#### Machine Learning Engineer

##### 2021 - Present

I developed ranking systems using XGBoost and Python, enhancing the relevance of jobseekers in online searches with a 10% increase in NDCG. I engineered vector embeddings from resumes using Sentence BERT and RoBERTa, creating a recommendation system that showcases similar candidates. I co-authored a paper presented at the SMC 2023 conference and designed an automatic resume classification system that significantly improved accuracy and recall using TensorFlow. I managed ML Ops for deploying machine learning services, incorporating CI/CD practices for security and currency. I implemented fairness strategies in our algorithms to ensure bias prevention across different racial groups and genders. Additionally, I maintained a dynamic GPT integrated with Hired.com, providing profile suggestions and handling over 200 real-time conversations.
