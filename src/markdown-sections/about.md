I work as a full-time developer. Currently, I'm living in [Montevideo, Uruguay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montevideo).
I have a Computer Engineering (similar to a Bachelor in Science) degree since 2015. I learned to program back when I was six, trying to my hand at BASIC using the [TK95](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TK95) computer. I started learning C at the sweet age of 17, thanks to my father gifting me a copy of [The C programming language](https://www.amazon.com/Programming-Language-2nd-Brian-Kernighan/dp/0131103628).

In my early career went through learned my fair share of programming languages from bare metal old [x86 assembly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86_assembly_language) to Java. During my 20's and went down the route of web software development, and did everything from simple websites, to writing my framework for scraping ones. Nowadays, I feel comfortable using Python for my general programming needs because it is a language that has a sweet spot in my heart. I also have experience leading teams too. Experienced developers should mentor more junior programmers in the right ways of software development.

I also worked as a lecturer and assistant at the [University of the Republic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_the_Republic_(Uruguay)) (UdelaR) for five years.

I consider myself a reasonably competent software developer with interest in the human side of software development. Computers are fascinating machines, but they're mostly a reflection of the people using them. As a firm believer of the [Agile manifesto](https://agilemanifesto.org/), I believe Software development is a human activity, therefore to be good at it, studying code isn't enough: one should study the people interactions around it too.
