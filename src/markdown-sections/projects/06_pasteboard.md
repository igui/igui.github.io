### Pasteboard

Pasteboard was a website that I created when working as a Ruby freelancer for an Uruguayan
client. The website was built using Ruby on Rails and allowed users to create and share websites
back in the day before social networks were popular. The website featured a simple editor
that allowed users to bookmark websites, add tags, notes and share them with friends. The website
was well-received by users and was used by my client to share interesting websites with his friends.
