### RPSolver

[RPSolver](https://github.com/igui/rpsolver) is a tool that was released as part of my publication for using
Photon Mapping for solving architecture problems. The tools allows the user
to upload an scene and the tool will generate a photon map rendering for it.
This tool was developed in C++ using the [OptiX](https://developer.nvidia.com/rtx/ray-tracing/optix) library for ray tracing and [CUDA](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-zone) for the parallel processing.
