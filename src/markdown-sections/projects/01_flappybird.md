### Flappy Bird

[Flappy Bird](https://github.com/igui/FlappyBird) is an OpenGL game made as assignment for a Computer Graphics course
in the University. The game is a clone of the popular mobile game Flappy Bird
where the player must tap the screen to make the bird fly and avoid the green
tubes. The game was made in C++ using the [OpenGL](https://www.opengl.org/)
library and the [SDL](https://www.libsdl.org/) library for the window
creation and input handling. The game features a main menu, a game over screen,
and a score system. We won the first place in the course competition with this game.
