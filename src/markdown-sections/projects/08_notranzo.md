### Notranzo site

NoTranzo was a project done as part of a web development course. The goal was to create a simple e-commerce website that allows users to browse products, add them to a cart, and checkout. The website was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It features a responsive design that works on both desktop and mobile devices.
