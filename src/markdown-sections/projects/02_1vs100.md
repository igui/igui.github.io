### One vs One Hundred

1 vs 100 for Windows Mobile was a project which began as an assigment of an University course in association with Microsoft Uruguay. The objective was to design a game based in the american TV show of the same name. The game must allow multiple players to join a game and compete against themselves requiring only an internet connection in their phones. We also required to make an Administration site to manage the content available within the game. The result was impressive as we proved that is possible to make a quality game in the Windows Mobile platform. The project was completed in 14 weeks.
