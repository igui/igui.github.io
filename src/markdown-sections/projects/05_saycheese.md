### Say Cheese

SayCheese was a project that I worked on as part of a web development course. The goal was to create a simple website that allows users to upload photos, add captions, and share them with friends. The website was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It features a responsive design that works on both desktop and mobile devices.
