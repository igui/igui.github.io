### Scraping Development Framework

Scraping Development Framework was a project to help automate the scraping process
of a website. The framework was built using Python, Qt and was designed to be
used by non-programmers. The goal was to make it easy for users to create scraping
scripts without having to write any code. The framework featured a visual editor
that allowed users to select elements on a webpage and define the scraping logic
using a simple drag-and-drop interface. The resulting script could then be run
to extract data from the website and save it to a file. The framework was used
to scrape data from various websites, including e-commerce sites, news sites, and
social media platforms. It was also used to create custom scrapers for clients
who needed to extract data from specific websites. The framework was well-received
by users and was praised for its ease of use and flexibility. It was used by
my teammates at Giglobaljob.
