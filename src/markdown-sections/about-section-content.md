I am a full-time developer currently residing in [Barcelona, Spain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcelona). I earned a degree in Computing Engineering in 2015 and completed a Master's in AI in 2023 from [KU Leuven](https://onderwijsaanbod.kuleuven.be/opleidingen/e/CQ_50268936.htm#activetab=diploma_omschrijving). My programming journey began at six years old when I experimented with BASIC on the [TK95](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TK95) computer. By 17, I was learning C, thanks to a book gifted by my father, [The C Programming Language](https://www.amazon.com/Programming-Language-2nd-Brian-Kernighan/dp/0131103628).

Early in my career, I navigated through a variety of programming languages, from the foundational [x86 assembly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86_assembly_language) to Java. During my twenties, I delved into web development, creating everything from simple websites to sophisticated frameworks for web scraping. Nowadays, Python is my go-to language for its versatility and the special place it holds in my heart. I also have substantial experience leading development teams, advocating for mentorship of junior programmers to foster their growth in software development.

Additionally, I spent five years as a lecturer and assistant at the [University of the Republic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_the_Republic_(Uruguay)) (UdelaR). I have authored three scientific articles in renowned publications on topics such as Explainable Multimodal Recommendations, Embedding, and Computer Graphics, contributing to the academic dialogue in these advanced fields.

I view myself as a competent software developer with a keen interest in the human aspects of technology. I believe that computers, while fascinating, largely reflect the characteristics of their users. As an adherent of the [Agile manifesto](https://agilemanifesto.org), I hold that software development is inherently a human-centric activity; thus, understanding people's interactions with technology is as crucial as understanding the technology itself.

As a seasoned Machine Learning Engineer and Software Development Leader with over a decade of expertise, I specialize in Recommendation and Classification Systems. I pioneered the development of advanced AI tools, including a recommender system that streamlines candidate vetting and a ranking system that enhances job search relevance on a leading HR platform. I also led the design and implementation of a POS software system extensively deployed across thousands of retail outlets in the US and Canada. My focus remains on developing recommendation and online classification systems, with an emphasis on explainability, interpretability, and bias mitigation. My robust educational background in machine learning and software engineering supports my commitment to innovative and ethical technology solutions.
