As a seasoned Machine Learning Engineer and Software Development Leader with over a decade of expertise, I specialize in Recommendation and Classification Systems. I pioneered the development of advanced AI tools, including a recommender system that streamlines candidate vetting and a ranking system that enhances job search relevance on a leading HR platform. I also led the design and implementation of a POS software system extensively deployed across thousands of retail outlets in the US and Canada. My focus remains on developing recommendation and online classification systems, with an emphasis on explainability, interpretability, and bias mitigation. My robust educational background in machine learning and software engineering supports my commitment to innovative and ethical technology solutions.
