I have created models and methods to improve recommendation systems and solve lighting problems in design.
My work on Align MacridVAE combines visual and text data to make recommendations more accurate and easier to understand.
I also used search data and transformers to learn how items are similar,
and developed a photon tracing method to make lighting design in architecture more efficient.
